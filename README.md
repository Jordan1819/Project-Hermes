# Project Hermes

**Project Hermes** is a collaborative web application designed to make text-based data entry fast, reliable, and shareable. With a simple, but secure user authentication system, it's a tool for teams to use in any text-based recordkeeping contexts. It allows users to enter text through a web interface and save their input simultaneously to both a **local SQL database** and **Google Sheets/Docs**, providing seamless synchronization between local storage and the cloud. Additionally, it allows verified users to search for and retrieve relevant database entries.
